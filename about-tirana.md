Tirana is the capital of Albania. It lies in the center of our country and it is considered a city of religious coexistence, as well as the center of culture, art, politics, and the economy. Tirana became the capital of Albania in 1920 and 1/3 of the populations lives there nowdays. It is known for its colorful Ottoman, Fascist and Soviet-era architecture.

One famous building is the [Clock Tower](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Clock_Tower_of_Tirana)  in the center of Tirana, which was built in XIX century, between 1822 – 1840. [Scanderbeg Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg_Square) is the main plaza in the city center named afer Albania National hero.

#### **“Mother Teresa” airport**

Airport facilities include free Wi-Fi and an Adrion press shop. Beside the baggage carousel in arrivals, there’s an ATM, a currency exchange office, and the airport’s tourism information desk. The airport has a duty-free shop and customs operates 24 hours a day.

### **GET AROUND**
#### **By Bus**

Public transportation in Tirana consists of a number of intra-city bus lines. A single trip costs 40 leks (there are only single tickets available) and tickets are sold in the bus by a conductor. Buses marked ‘Unaze’ are for the ring road and travel in a loop around the city centre. There are also lines serving suburban shopping centers and the Tirana Airport.

#### **By foot**

The city centre is small enough to be explored through walking. Walking is a rewarding experience, but beware that there is no continuity in sidewalk width, construction material or condition. Sidewalks frequently end abruptly, have large holes, or are very narrow. Pay attention while walking or you may end up spraining your ankle or falling in a hole. Street names are subject to change, so locals rarely know them. It is advised to navigate by landmarks instead of addresses or street names. You can orient yourself using the intersection between the Lana River and “Dëshmorët e Kombit” street, which roughly bisects the central part of Tirana into four sections. At this intersection are the recognizable “Pyramid” and “Taiwan Center”.

####   **By Taxi**

#### **By bicycle**

Moving around the city by bike might be the best way to go to your destination, but you need to be quite careful and be safe. For all other bike equipment or repairs, Rruga Qemal Stafa is Tirana’s (location: [link](https://osm.org/go/xexSwKz1L--?m=)) unofficial “bike street” with lots of little, inexpensive bike shops. New combined bus and bike lanes have been opened recently on some main streets. Bike-only lanes are located on Skanderbeg Square, Deshmoret e Kombit Boulevard and on sidewalks along Lana River and Kavaja Street. However, cycling in the main street can be quite dangerous as lanes are narrow or occupied by parked vehicles (but car drivers have become more careful during the last few years) and a lot of pedestrians jump in.

####  **Local currency**

The Lek (Albanian: Leku Shqiptar; plural Lekë) (sign: L; code: ALL) is the official currency of Albania. Official exchange rates are found at bankofalbania.org. And one of the most known exchanges is Iliria’98 which has no commisions.

#### **Getting an Albanian SIM card**

You can get an Albanian SIM card at the airport, in one of the shops at the airport, which are very easy to spot from ALBtelecom and Vodafone.

The SIM card costs 200-500 ALL (around 2-3 EUR), depending on plans you choose, it also has left money you can use to communicate or buy a package which is a good deal to not spend during your stay here.  

You will need to have a passport in order to buy the number.

Also if not buying a number be carefull with roaming usage. Some of our speakers have  been charged a lot previously.
